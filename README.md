## Project Description
In this project, I wanted to create a prototype of a household recycling machine. After researching the subject for quite a bit, it became clear to me that household recycling will be automated, as it provides great benefits for the society, as well as the individual households themselves. However, the problem is extremely complex and will require a great team of engineers to complete successfully. 

My basic idea was to create an automated recycling bin, standardized to a size of a dishwasher. Although mechanical systems of such a bin are very difficult to design (since rubbish comes in all forms and shapes), the fundamental challenge of this machine is the material classification system. At the time of the project, no such system was created or open-source. Looking back, computer vision (perhaps, also with the use of depth image) is the way to go; however, the tech I used here can also be promising for this use. Original implementation was done by ken1row/libfreenect2_altered.

### Installation:
